## Overview

Video helmet display that was build for an Air Guitar competition in 2019. This was intended to be a successor to the [Air Guitar Video Display](/projects/hands-on/video-head). Using some python code I was able to trigger video displays on one of those hologram fans you find mounted to walls in the outlet malls. I rigged it to my face and got to work on a simple python script!

## Takeaways

Had a blast, wish I had more time to put in some saftey measures for the firing trigger. There was an electronic wiring problem during the show, but everyone stuck around to play with it later!

## Notes

- DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME: Fans on faces are dangerous kiddos
