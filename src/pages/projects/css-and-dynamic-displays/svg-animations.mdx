## Overview

Random exercises in complex svg animations. The goal was to build some logos using over the top animations while learning how svg animations work.

## Media

<div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
  <Image
    src="/projects/babybel.png"
    alt="logo for baby-bel"
    width={500}
    height={500}
    className="w-full"
  />
  <Image
    src="/projects/premiere.png"
    alt="crane animation for premiere camera systems"
    width={500}
    height={500}
    className="w-full"
  />
  <Image
    src="/projects/troubadour.png"
    alt="logo for Troubadour Hostel"
    width={500}
    height={500}
    className="w-full"
  />
</div>

## Technology

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Takeaways

Great understanding on how to animate svgs. I got nerdery with some of the implementations, don't think I would ever use some of these in a real world scenario, but the Baby-bel option does seem the most 'usable' for that edge case.
