## Overview

The goal was to provide a music player that users could form events to listen to a playlist. The users could upvote and downvote songs in the queue, add to the queue, and watch awesome audio visualizers.

## Takeaways

This was a team effort (team of 3). After setting up the initial repo and socket.io stuff with the team, I was tasked with building the visualizers. After we built our project, we had to present our project at a formal graduation ceremony for Dev Bootcamp. We found because our project had a story and appeal that a lot of business representives without technical insights really latched onto the concept and wanted to talk with us.

## Notes

- This was a final project for Dev Bootcamp
